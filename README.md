In this Java project, an ATM interface is developed to facilitate banking transactions. Users are required to log in using a unique ID and PIN combination to access their accounts securely. Upon successful authentication, users are presented with a menu of options including Withdraw, Deposit, Display Account Details, Transfer, and Quit.

The interface ensures a seamless banking experience by providing intuitive options for various transactions. Users can choose to withdraw funds from their accounts, deposit money, view their account details to check balances and transaction history, transfer funds between accounts, and exit the system when done.

Security is a priority in this interface, as users must provide both a unique ID and a corresponding PIN to access their accounts. This ensures that only authorized individuals can perform transactions and view sensitive account information.
